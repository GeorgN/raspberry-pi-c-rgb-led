# Raspberry Pi C RGB Led

Another little C program. This time to have a go at software pulse width modulation with an RGB Led. So my C GPIO library using the 'sysfs interface' is slowly moving along! Refer to the wiki page <https://github.com/mse240966/raspberry-pi-c-rgb-led/wiki> for more information.

## Example

```bash
$ sudo ./rgbLed
